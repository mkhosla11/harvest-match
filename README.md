# CIS-4500-5500-Group-41-Final-Project
For our final project for CIS 4500/5500, we have decided to shift gears from our initial milestone one proposal. Based on feedback received from our TA and a deeper dive into sourcing our data sets and web scraping, we believe our initial proposition would not have large enough datasets nor would require complex queries. Furthermore, there were no interesting relationships among our datasets. Thus our new project proposal is a climate visualizer application that allows the user to map relationships between various climate metrics and determine relationships between growing metropolitan areas and crop yield. This can help researchers and agriculture workers determine what crops to produce and what regions they will be prosperous in across the globe.

We hope to implement an interactive map of climate variables, country specific dashboards for data trends, and a searchable table view. We hope to implement (time-permitting) predictive modeling for future crop yield loss and climate risk, city-specific data, examining population density vs. heat exposure, downloadable reports, and animated map features.
